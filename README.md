# Crypto App

Technologies and tools used in practice: <br>
- Flutter library in the Dart programming language
- Firebase database
- VsCode or Android Studio IDE
- API for Crypto Exchange -> min-api.cryptocompare.com


My mobile application that I developed with Flutter has the following features: <br>
- Showing up-to-date crypto data simultaneously
- Detail page and graphics created to analyze crypto coins in detail
- A chat room created to be able to chat about crypto within the application
- Profile page created to change the username, add a profile photo or log out of the application
